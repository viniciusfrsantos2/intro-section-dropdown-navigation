## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javasctipt DOM Manipulaton
- Event Delegation

### What I learned

During the development of the project, I learnt more about event delegation. It is a topic that I will continue to study in order to implement the DRY principle wherever possible in future projects. I gained a better understanding of responsive images and their properties, as well as accessibility and user interaction. This is an important area for me to improve in as a developer.

### Continued development

I want to improve my ability to create fluid and responsive layouts. I don't yet consider myself capable of developing any type of layout, so I want to devote more time to studying documentation in order to consolidate my knowledge of web development.
